This chapter is about how to use visualization and transformations to explore data in a systematic way. Otherwise known as Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA.

This is an iterative cycle
1. Generate questions about your data
2. Search for answers by visualizing, transforming and modeling your data
3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. 
EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you will always need to investigate the quality of the data.

To do data cleaning you'll need to deploy all the tools: visualization, transformation and modeling.

## Questions

The goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of the data.
