First we'll install tidyverse.
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This installs the packages tidyverse, ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, purrr, dyplyr, stringr, and forcats

We'll need 3 additional packages as well

```
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

These packages provide data on airline flights, world development, and baseball.

# First Steps

Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?

Start with the ggplot2 dataframe "mpg"

```
library(tidyverse)
mpg
```

For this one we want to look at **displ** which is the engine size in liters and **hwy** which is the car's fuel efficiency on the highway

```
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

This plot shows a negative relationship between the two variables in this case.
Big engines use more fuel.


## Ggplot
ggplot()  creates a coordinate system you can add layers to.
  The first argument is the dataset to use in this case we used the mpg dataset
  This will be empty until we add layers to it.
    geom_point() adds a layer of points that creates a scatterplot
    ggplot comes with many different types of layers that can be worked together or seperately
    
    Each geom function within ggplot takes a mapping argument. This defines the # of variables in the dataset that are mapped to visual properties
    mappings are always tied to the aes(), and the x and y arguments of the aes()
      What is the x and y axis?
      
### Graphing template
```
ggplot (data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

### Exercises
1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg
4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl.
5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is this not useful?

```
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
I see an empty graph.

```
mtcars
nrow(mtcars)
ncol(mtcars)
```
There are 32 rows and 11 columns in the mtcars dataset.

```
?mpg
```
drv is a categorical variable that is made up of 
  "f" = front-wheel drive
  "r" = rear-wheel drive
  "4" = 4 wheel drive
  
```
ggplot (data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```

```
ggplot (data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
This is not useful because this is mapping two categorical values against each other. It tells you nothing except for what class and drv a specific data point is. This doesn't show frequency or any kind of trend whatsoever.
