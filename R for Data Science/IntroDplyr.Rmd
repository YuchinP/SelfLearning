This is an introduction to using dplyr. Very infrequently do we receive data in the correct format we need to create visualizations from. 
Often we will need to rename variables, create new ones, re-order observations, or any kind of transformation that will make it more digestible to work with.

We will do this learning the dyplr package and a new dataset on flights departing NYC in 2013.

```
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll start by exploring the dataset


```
flights
```

This will output the first 10 of 33,776 rows and 10 of 19 columns. This is called a Tibble, a dataframe tweaked to work better in the tidyverse.

The various data types for reference
  int =  integer
  dbl = doubles or real numbers
  chr = character vectors or strings
  dttm = date-times
  
  lgl = logical (true or false)
  fctr = factor, categorical variables with fixed possible values (green, yellow, red)
  date = dates
  
## 5 keys

There are 5 key dplyr functions we will learn that will cover most of the data manipulation
  Pick observations by their values *Filter()*
  Reorder the rows *arrange()*
  Pick variables by their name *select()*
  Create new variables with functions of existing variables *Mutate()*
  Collapse many values down to a single summary *Summarize()*
  
These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These 6 functions provide the verbs for data manipulation.

All verbs work similarly:
  1. The first argument is a data frame
  2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names
  3. The result is a new data frame
  
### Filter
Filter allows us to subset observations based on their values.

For example we want o see all flights on January 1st.
```
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
This returns the result, but if we want to continue using it we need to save it to a variable.

```
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

If you want execute AND assign a variable wrap it all in parenthesis.

```
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```
