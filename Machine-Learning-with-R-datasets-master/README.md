# Data for Machine Learning with R
[Machine Learning with R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-r) by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets
available online unless you buy the book and create a [user account](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support) which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets
are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.
